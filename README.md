# Fuddle RPC

[Fuddle](https://github.com/fuddle-io/fuddle) is a service registry that can be
used for client side service discovery and cluster observability.

This repository contains the public gRPC service definition, which is shared by
the Fuddle server and all client SDKs.

See [docs/architecture/registry_protocol.md](https://github.com/fuddle-io/fuddle/docs/architecture/registry_protocol.md).
